TODO in session-rewrite-branch:
-------------------------------

Before merge:
* Ask for password

Can be done directly after merge:
* Groups in contact list
* Show offline/online
* Registration

Later:
* Event inbox in contact list window
* Event list in tray, rather than popping top event all the time.
* Reconnect when disconnected

Transports:
* Fix vcard.
* Fix add contact.
* Handle multiple Jabber accounts in transports dialog.
* Handle better the scenario when you are already registered to a
local transport and you can not register another transport because of
this.
