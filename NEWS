NEWS in 0.10.2:
===============
- Add run-time controlled debugging facilities (Richard).
- Display an event in the group# chat window when a user changes the
topic, previously it just happened with no indication of who changed
it or when (Kristian Rietveld).
- Changed the account ID for Jabber IDs back to 'username@server' and
make the resource a separate entity in the accounts.xml (note: there
is some extra code to make sure the same problems that occurred last
time don't reoccur this time with invalid user names when trying to
connect) (Martyn). 
- Updated the spell checker dialog to use "Replace" instead of "OK"
(Martyn). 
- Cleaned up the glade windows and dialogs so windows are not shown
automatically, this reduces flickering when they are created (Richard).
- Fixed the assistant used to add accounts so it now accepts a
username of username@server and make the resource optional on the next
(connections) page (Martyn).
- Fixed the add account assistant so that account details are properly
checked before proceeding to the following page (Martyn).
- Updated the personal information dialog so there is no longer a
progress bar when saving or loading, it just makes widgets
insensitive. Also the buttons are now Save and Cancel which is clearer
(Martyn). 
- Fixed the jabber chat room join presence handling so it actually
checks the presence message is for the right room instead of just
accepting any old presence message - this means auto-connecting on
start up works properly and will also give the correct error if you
can't join for some reason (Martyn).
- The chat rooms window now allows selection of multiple rooms for
joining, deleting, etc and the dialog will close when a rooms are
joined. Chat rooms will also be joined on the treeview "row-activate"
signal now (Martyn).
- Updated the CSS used for logging so the font isn't so big (Martyn).
- Improve the X screensaver detection (Richard, Tommi Komulainen).
- Added the 'x' to close separate chat tabs back in (Richard, Martyn).
- Improve the build scripts (Richard, Bryan Pepple).
- Fixed #334890, Make it possible to forget saved passwords (Paul Van
Tilburg). 
- Fixed #334390, Use iso-codes for the language names for spell
checking (Nickolay V. Shmyrev, Richard).
- Fixed #331910, Make the accounts info file not readable by others
than the owner (Richard).
- Fixed #332058, Don't spell check chat commands like "/me" (Ross
Burton). 
- Fixed #332063, Don't spell check numeric strings, e.g. "1234" (Ross
Burton). 
- Fixed #332169, Update the libnotify code to work with the 0.3.2 API
(Martyn, Brian Pepple).
- Fixed #332713, Use the default foreground colour for the classic
chat theme (Richard).
- Fixed #332240, Change some keyboard mnemonics for chat windows
(Brian Pepple).

any error that might of occurred (Martyn). 
- Added typing notification on the roster (Martyn, Richard). 
- Added a chat theme selection in the preferences to choose between
Classic and Blue (which is a block message format), try it!
(Richard). 
- Don't ellipsize text in the menu created for status presets, this
usually is not shown in full when using the menu on the tray icon
(Martyn).  
- Added libnotify support for contacts coming online and sending first
time messages (note: this only works with libnotify 0.2.1 at the
moment, not with the 0.3.x API, if you have 0.3.x you might have to
disable it with configure --disable-libnotify) (Martyn). 
- Use a GtkWindow instead of a GnomeApp for the main window. The
widget spacing for toolbars and menus is much better now (Martyn). 
- Fixed #306719, Make sure Wordstar style key bindings work (i.e
Ctrl+Insert copies, Ctrl+Delete and cuts Shift+Insert pastes)
(Richard).  
- Fixed #332052, Be more flexible with DTD validation in XML files
(Richard, Ross Burton). 
- Fixed #332423, Make sure special characters are escaped when saving
to XML files (for accounts, presets, and contact groups) (Richard,
Jonatan Magnusson). 
- Fixed #322030, Added the 'x' button back onto chat tabs to close
conversations (Richard, Sjoerd Simons) 
- Fixed #332333, Fixed weird menu detachment behaviour (Diego
González). 
- Fixed #142188, Don't scroll the chat window when drag and dropping
across them (Richard).

 about a missing resource in the account id, instead we now signal the
 error and the user is informed so they are able to correct it
 (Martyn). 
- Fixed #331707, Depend on GTK+ 2.8 because we are using some GTK+
stock icons from it (Brian Pepple). 
- Fixed #331868, Corrected some UI typos (Clytie Siddall).
